# accrua-rs
accrua-rs aims to be an accruals calculation library, focusing on the OTC derivatives market
and providing users the tools as defined in the ISDA Defnitions handbook.

This is a pre-alpha version, which, as of now, I consider a placeholder, rather than a library that
could be used in any environment.
